# Food_App
# Chill Grill Food Receie App

It is the project where user can search any kind of recipe with full detail recipe. In this Project even user can watch the Video available on youtube related to that recipe for
more clarification. In some of the Recipe there is external Source as well to see detail of recipe. 
The main motive for creating this project is to use different kinds of functionality of JavaScripts and implement designing like:
- Local Storage
- API to POST & GET request of particular User.
- Import and Export Functions for Navbar
